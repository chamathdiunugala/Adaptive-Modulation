# 🚀 ML-Enhanced GNU Radio Modulation Detection

**An intelligent software-defined radio system that automatically detects and adapts to different digital modulation schemes using deep learning.**

## 🎯 What It Does

This project combines the power of machine learning with GNU Radio to create a smart radio receiver that can:

- **Automatically identify** digital modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM) in real-time
- **Adapt its demodulation** strategy based on what it detects
- **Provide visual feedback** showing signal quality and detection confidence
- **Switch between modulations** automatically for testing and demonstration

Think of it as a "smart radio" that doesn't need manual tuning - it figures out what type of signal it's receiving and adjusts itself accordingly.
